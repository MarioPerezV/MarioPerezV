I've started self-taught studies in Java since 2019, going through several programming languajes such as PHP, HTML, CSS, Python, MySQL, but a couple of months ago I found myself needing to create a GitHub profile, the funny thing is that now I realize how important it is. That is the explanation for the number of repositories and files in such a short time, it's not that much either.
